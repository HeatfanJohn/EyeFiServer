eyefiserver (2.0)

  * The server can now execute an arbitrary command on each uploaded photo. This
    is a very dangerous feature and should be used with caution. On the other
    hand it is also very cool. You can have the server FTP files, display them
    using an image viewer, or even run sorting programs on the images.
  * Improved security: the server now generates its own nonces instead of using
    one that was hard coded. The nonce is based on the random library provided
    by python. The INTEGRITYDIGEST field is also checked.
  * Ability to read settings from a configuration file (there is a included
    DefaultSettings.ini for reference). The file allows you to configure the
    listen port, console output, logging, download location, and execute on
    upload, and upload key.
  * Some other notable improvements but not really features are the addition of
    regression tests and support for Python 2.5. The regression tests are
    interesting since I run them against the official Eye-Fi Manager to make
    sure my behavior is a close match.
