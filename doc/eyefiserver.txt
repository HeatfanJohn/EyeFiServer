NAME
eyefiserver - Daemon for receiving files from Eye-Fi SD devices

SYNOPSIS
eyefiserver [options]

DESCRIPTION
This starts an HTTP server on port 59278 that will receive files.

OPTIONS
  -h, --help  
      Display a short usage help.
  --conf file  
      Additional location for configuration files. Options are first read in
      /etc/eyefiserver.conf, then in ~/eyefiserver.conf. Any file name specified
      here will overwrite the values already parsed.

      That option might be used multiple times. Latest values override previous ones.
  --log file  
      Log to file.

DIAGNOSTICS
You can increase log level up to DEBUG to get additional messages.
See eyefiserver.conf(5).

The logger doesn't catch exceptions from do_POST threads and such. So these
errors are logged to stderr only, not in log files. You should avoid debugging
while running as a daemon.

FILES
- /etc/eyefiserver.conf
- ~/eyefiserver.conf
- /var/log/eyefiserver.log
